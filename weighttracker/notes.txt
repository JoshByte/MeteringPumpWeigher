This is my notes of changes and thoughts of how I go about things. This way I can better explain my desicion making and improvments as well as things I've learned or would change.

I've run into the issue to where I'm thinking best case scenario where everything passes first try by asking for only 3 weights. What if the unit is failing so much that is requires
more than 3 weights.
I need to try running a while loop that keeps going until my list has 3 acceptable readings.
