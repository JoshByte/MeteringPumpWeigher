This is my notes of changes and thoughts of how I go about things. This way I can better explain my desicion making and improvments as well as things I've learned or would change.

I've run into the issue to where I'm thinking best case scenario where everything passes first try by asking for only 3 weights. What if the unit is failing so much that is requires
more than 3 weights.
I need to try running a while loop that keeps going until my list has 3 acceptable readings.

In this project I wanted to try and incorporate as much as I currently know about OOP.

The hardest thing I've had to do so far is making sure I keep track of the scope of the variables and getting them to work with each other.
What I like is this program has made me think about different ways to make it work. For example:
Having the if statement be == at first then trying != instead. Theres many ways to solve problems but there are some that are better than others.

When I come back I need to fix the looping problem with the checking. I need to change it to get only 3 readings and not 4.
It is getting closer. Testing.py is looking better soon it will be pretty good.
