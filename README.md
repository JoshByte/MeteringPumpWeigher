# MeteringPumpWeigher

This project is about calibrating single metering pumps.
With this being a personal project for me to practice python concepts this is a far from perfect project.

I built this project to serve me and my collegues as a way to confirm our findings in our jobs as Calibration Technicians.

Please excuse the notes.txt file. It is my own thoughts about the project and to help remind myself of what I'm doing since I was unable to get this done in a day.

The only python library used was pyinputplus everything else is plug and play.

Hope you enjoy this little project of mine.
All critiques are highly welcomed.
